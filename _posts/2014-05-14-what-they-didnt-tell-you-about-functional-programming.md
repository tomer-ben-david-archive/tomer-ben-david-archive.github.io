This is the book we have been waiting for.

The good: It provides what you wanted and what it's title is - "Functional programming in scala - indeed."
The bad: No jokes, no real fun.  I like books with jokes and fun, the author does a good job in describing the issue in a very clear way, but hey couldn't they put some fun into the book? (kinda learn you a haskell for a great good)

CHAPTER 2: A very good job in describing functions.  In currying, partial functions, how generics or polymorphic functions as they are named play a big role.  Why most of framework functions are like someFunc(A, B, C).  Does a real good job on this.  It's still an introduction to the whole subject, but overall, by the end of this chapter, you will get to know tail recursion, generics (or type parameters) currying, partial functions, how to compose functoins, why its like solving equations and stuff like that.
