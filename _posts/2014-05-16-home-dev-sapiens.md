*homo-dev-sapiens* has long ago gone beyond the *software-development* realm into others.  for example releasing *homo-sapiens-sapiens* from the [burden of eating - Soylent](http://soylent.me).  Into aeronatics, medicine, physics and the rest of the world problems.

The way the *homo-dev-sapiens* works, is, it identifies a problem, and then:

1. He opens a bug in its favorite ticket system.  (I like [trac](http://trac.edgewall.org)) (humans waste time in eating it costs lot of money and energy)
1. He does some research and breaks the problem into subproblems and thus opens sub-tasks.
1. Moves the task into *in-progress* and starts working on it. 
1. Once he finished, moves it into *fixed* and releases a POC like soylent.  There is some beta era and after that GA.
1. Bug moves into closed status.

In a few years *homo-dev-sapiens* will finish resolving more and more of world most difficult problems unsolved by people proficient in its domain field.  It's percentage in population is growing higher and higher.  We expect by a few years most of *homo-sapiens-sapiens* being extinct by *homo-dev-sapiens* just as happened to *homo-n-1* by *homo-n*, afterwards we can highly expect the dev-sapiens to be extinct by the *robot-sapiens-sapiens*, its own creation this time.
