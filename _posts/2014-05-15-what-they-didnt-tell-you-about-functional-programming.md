Hey! If you are new to functional programming or to scala here are a few tips.

You must understand that *map, Future, Monad, flatMap* are an inherent part of the system.  They have tweaks and are unfortunately hard to understand.  You must understand very well the mechanisms behind them.  I will try to help you with that.

So

Repeat after me:

map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map, map

I hope you feel more comfortable with *map* now.  Now that it's part of your dictionary lets drill down into it.
